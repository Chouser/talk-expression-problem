- expression problem
    - implement an abstract method on a class outside your control
        - the old OOP draw example
        - provide your own shape objects
        - but what about strings?  why not draw strings?
    - option 1: wrap it
        - messy -- equality, etc.
    - option 2: monkey patch
        - what if someone else wants to add a draw method
    - one good solution: generic methods
- multimethods
    - dispatch function to take args and produce a dispatch value
    - implementation functions associated with dispatch values
    - example of string draw
- protocols
    - named groups of methods
    - less general than multimethods
      - dispatch is always class of first arg
    - "platform fast" -- Halloway
    - example of string draw
- records
    - "platform fast" concrete objects
    - act just like clojure hash-maps, but are also simple Java objects
- types
    - like records, but even simpler -- don't act like maps
